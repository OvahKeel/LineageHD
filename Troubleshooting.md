# Common Issues

**When I click play it pops up saying it can't find libcocos2d.dll:**

To fix this, open the game folder where you extracted/installed the game. You'll see 3 files that are named as follows:
  
* vcredist_x86_2010.exe
* vcredist_x86_2012.exe
* vcredist_x86_2015.exe
  
Install them one by one and the game should be able to run. Make sure you close the connector completley before trying again.
