# Common Issues

**When I click play it pops up saying it can't find libcocos2d.dll:**

To fix this, open the game folder where you extracted/installed the game. You'll see 3 files that are named as follows:
  
* vcredist_x86_2010.exe
* vcredist_x86_2012.exe
* vcredist_x86_2015.exe
  
Install them one by one and the game should be able to run. Make sure you close the connector completley before trying again.

If it still doesn't work, install .NET Framework and DirectX:
